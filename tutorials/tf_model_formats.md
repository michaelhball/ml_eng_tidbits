A SavedModel is  a 'dictionary containing serialized signatures and the state needed to run them, 
including variable values and vocabularies.' Refer [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/saved_model#the_savedmodel_format_on_disk) 
for a discussion of the different files that make up a SavedModel, but in simple terms it should be noted that 
a SavedModel is a directory, not a single file.
