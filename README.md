# ML Tidbits

This is just a project to compile a bunch of useful ML snippets. The project is not intended to be 
'run', and the various pieces don't necessarily go together. They are reusable pieces of code that 
I find myself needing over and over again. 

I don't claim that these snippets represent my unique insight and ability. They are a product of my 
having read countless blogs/forums/implementations and customized things as needed for my own projects 
(hence my best efforts to attribute inspiration where relevant). This repository is first and foremost 
a tool-shed for myself, but one in which I hope you'll find something useful.
