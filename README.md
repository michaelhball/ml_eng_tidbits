# ML Tidbits

This is just a project to compile a bunch of useful ML snippets. The project is not intended to be 
'run', and the various pieces don't necessarily go together. They are reusable pieces of code that 
I find myself needing over and over again. 

I don't claim that these snippets represent my unique insight and ability. They are a product of my 
having read countless blogs/forums/implementations and customized things as needed for my own projects 
(hence my best efforts to attribute inspiration where relevant). This repository is first and foremost 
a tool-shed for myself, but one in which I hope you'll find something useful.

This README acts as a table of contents and index, organising & linking to the various files/documents 
that are themselves not well organised.

## AWS

The AWS notes are mostly snippets or step-by-step instructions for how to repeat the setup of 
something. The topics are:
* [increase ec2 storage](https://github.com/michaelhball/ml_tidbits/blob/0450bc2d9830a1846cdaddf992ca4d74c3c62604/ml_eng_tutorials/increase_ec2_storage.md)
* 

## Tensorflow

Almost all Tensorflow snippets I have here are provided inside the [```tf```](/ml_tidbits/tf) directory. The files I 
have are as follows:
* [```callbacks.py```](/ml_tidbits/tf/callbacks.py) contains a collection of training callbacks for use 
with ```.fit``` function
    * [RestoreBestModel](https://github.com/michaelhball/ml_tidbits/blob/0450bc2d9830a1846cdaddf992ca4d74c3c62604/ml_tidbits/tf/callbacks.py#L4-L26)
    *  
* [```models.py```](/ml_tidbits/tf/models.py) contains a collection of utils for model 
loading/modifying/customizing/converting etc.
